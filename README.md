## REQUIREMENTS:
### ●	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Delta 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Delta 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Delta 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the z1-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z1-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the z2-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z2-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z3-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z3-axis assembly.

### BASE: the base in a delta 3D printer serves as the static structure that supports the printer's moving components, facilitating the precise and controlled movement required for 3D printing.

### HOLDER: holders contribute to the stability, accuracy, and functionality of the 3D printer's moving components.

### TOP COVER: In the context of a delta 3D printer, a top cover typically refers to a protective or enclosing structure positioned at the top of the printer.

### TOP COVER FRAME: The top cover frame in a delta 3D printer is designed to enclose the upper portion of the printer, providing a protective covering for the internal components. It may be constructed from materials such as metal, plastic, or a combination of materials, depending on the design and specifications of the 3D printer.

### LINEAR RAIL: a "linear rail" refers to a component used in the motion system to guide and support the movement of various parts along a linear path.

### MOTOR: a "motor" refers to an electric motor that is used to drive and control the movement of various components within the printer. Motors are essential components in the motion system of 3D printers, providing the mechanical force needed to move the print head, the build platform, and other parts with precision.

### BASE: base typically refers to the stationary foundation or platform on which the entire printer is built. The base provides structural support for the moving components and ensures the stability of the printer during operation.

### BED: bed typically refers to the build platform or print bed. The bed is the surface on which the initial layer of a 3D print adheres and is gradually built up layer by layer during the printing process.

### SLIDE WITH CONNECTOR: slide with connector in the context of a delta 3D printer might refer to a component related to the movement or sliding mechanism in the printer.

### CONNECTING RODS: connecting rods in a delta 3D printer are structural components that play a critical role in the printer's movement system. They enable the controlled and coordinated motion of the print head, allowing for precise positioning during the 3D printing process. 

### EXTRUDER: extruder refers to the component responsible for feeding filament into the hotend, melting the filament, and then depositing the melted material layer by layer to create a three-dimensional object. The extruder is a fundamental part of the 3D printing process and is present in various types of 3D printers, including delta printers.

### PINS: Pins can refer to the metal connectors within these plugs or sockets that establish electrical connections between different components, such as motors, sensors, or the control board.

### MOTOR WITH GEAR: In a delta 3D printer, a "motor with gear" typically refers to a stepper motor that is equipped with a gear mechanism. Stepper motors are commonly used in 3D printers to control the precise movement of various components, such as the carriages along the towers or the rotation of lead screws.

### LCD: the LCD in a delta 3D printer enhances the user experience by providing a visual interface for controlling and monitoring the printer's functions. It serves as a central hub for user interaction and configuration adjustments throughout the 3D printing process.
